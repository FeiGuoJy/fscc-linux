This document defines many guidelines that should be adhered to when developing
against fscc-linux. These guidelines will make the codebase more readable,
extensible, and portable.

Printing Guidelines
=========================

When using printk's inside the codebase use these log levels where appropriate.

KERN_EMERG    - (not used)
KERN_ALERT    - When something happens that the user should know about (e.g. 
                data loss).
KERN_CRIT     - (not used)
KERN_ERR      - When a function inside the codebase returns an error.
KERN_WARNING  - When a user does something that is valid but probably 
                unintentional (e.g. set the trigger level to 1).
KERN_NOTICE   - When code gets to a part it shouldn't (e.g. unknown ioctl).
KERN_INFO     - When helpful information is to be given to a user (e.g 
                firmware version).
KERN_DEBUG    - General purpose debugging.

The message should start in lowercase and end without a period. Also, always 
prepend the message with the DEVICE_NAME #define.

printk(KERN_DEBUG DEVICE_NAME " initializing port\n");
